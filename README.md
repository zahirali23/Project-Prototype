# Final Year Project  PSDP
Exploratory Analysis & Prototype

## Ali Zahir w1762656 - Data Science & Analytics

### What the project does
This GitHub repository hosts a machine learning project aimed at predicting football injuries from player stats. It features data preprocessing, analysis visuals, and a Random Forest predictive model.

### Usefulness of project
This project is useful for identifying injury risk factors in football and aiding in the development of targeted prevention strategies to improve player safety and team performance.

### Technology used
The project utilizes Python for data analysis, with libraries including Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for histogram generation, and Seaborn for heatmap visualization. These technologies support robust data processing and insightful visual analytics.

### Motivation behind the project
The motivation for this project stems from the significant impact that injuries have on football players and teams. Injuries can sideline players, affect team dynamics, and lead to financial and competitive disadvantages. By using data-driven approaches, the project aims to reduce these negative impacts through early identification of injury risks, allowing for proactive measures and informed decision-making to safeguard player health and optimize team performance.

### Challenges faced
The project faced challenges like sourcing a robust dataset, fine-tuning the predictive model, and designing clear, informative visuals. Data collection required integrating detailed player stats with manually compiled injury records. The Random Forest model needed careful adjustment to predict accurately, and creating visuals involved balancing aesthetic appeal with ease of interpretation.
